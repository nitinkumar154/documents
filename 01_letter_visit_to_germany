 Dear Sumeet,
Hope you are doing well in your life. It's been long time we have not in touch with each other. Five years, its a long time, many things has been changed in my life. Firstly, I have recently got job as technical manager in well-known tech giant AMAZON Inc. Last year I have got married to my best friend since college time, Kuheli. 
I have a good news for you and I cann't wait more to reveal the secret to you. I will be visiting Munic, Germany  as a part of my official tour. I guess after reading this news you will be excited too. I would love to meet to your family and spend some quality time with them. My plan to visit your city in month of June. I know its summer in your country. During this time, we can explore sundry of places from hilly terrain to beaches.
I have booked my stays nearby your place. I would love to see famous Monuments of Ashok nearby your location. The Cinema hall we have read in story books, we will visit that over some weekend. I am also facinated about the Sunny Beach near Munich. We should plan some picnic on that beach during weekend.

Finally, I am counting down my days as this trip approaching. I want to have lots of fun together and want to compensate the time as I could not get in touch with you.
Please make all required arrangements and take few days off from your office work.
See you soon.
Your best friend 
Nitin Kumar
